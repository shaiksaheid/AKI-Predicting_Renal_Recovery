# üß† AKI Prediction System

A Flask-based web application to predict renal recovery outcomes in ICU patients diagnosed with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) using machine learning.

## üìå Description

This system uses patient vitals, lab results, and clinical data to determine the likelihood of recovery or death. The prediction is powered by a Random Forest Classifier and presented via a responsive web UI. Results are stored in a SQLite database, and model performance can be visualized through an interactive dashboard.
